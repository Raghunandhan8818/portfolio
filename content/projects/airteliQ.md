## **Project Description:**

Participating in the AirteliQ hackathon, in collaboration with Airtel and WhatsApp, was an extraordinary experience where our team made a remarkable impact. We developed a Saas (Software as a Service) product aimed at improving the interaction between students, faculty, and educational institutions using WhatsApp APIs.

## **Key Features and Achievements:**

- **Integration of GPT with WhatsApp:** We integrated GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology with WhatsApp, enhancing the capabilities of automated communication and responses.

- **Image-to-Text Conversion:** Implemented a feature to convert images to text, making information more accessible and interactive.

- **Productivity Tracking:** Designed a system to track and enhance productivity, facilitating more efficient learning and teaching processes.

- **Notes Taking:** Introduced a feature for students to take notes directly within the WhatsApp platform, making it convenient and accessible.

- **Quiz on WhatsApp:** Developed a feature that allows for interactive quizzes to be conducted directly on WhatsApp, promoting engagement and learning.

- **Task Assignment and Evaluation:** Enabled task assignment and evaluation processes to be carried out seamlessly within WhatsApp, enhancing collaboration and feedback mechanisms.

- **Automated Photocopying Process:** Streamlined the photocopying process by automating it within the WhatsApp platform, saving time and resources.


## **Recognition and Success:**

Our project stood out as the only student team among the top 11 finalists in the hackathon, which comprised well-established startups. **We garnered recognition and praise not only from Airtel and WhatsApp but also from prominent sponsors, including Meta, TechGig, BYJU'S, Rapido, Swiggy, and Delhivery.**

This project not only showcases our technical expertise but also our ability to solve real-world challenges with creativity and innovation. It is a testament to our dedication to pushing the boundaries of technology to enhance education and communication through WhatsApp.
