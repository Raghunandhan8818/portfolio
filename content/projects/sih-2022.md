**Project Description:**

This project aimed to address the challenge of automating the unloading, loading, and stacking of rice sacks between warehouses and trains, a critical task in the logistics industry.I had the privilege of developing the software part of the iStacker project, created for the **Smart India Hackathon 2022**. 

**Key Contributions:**

- **Robot Control Software:** The software served as the brain behind the project, enabling precise control of the robotic system. This software was crucial in instructing the robot to place rice sacks in a 3D configuration, specifying parameters such as row, column, and layer as specified by the government norms to ensure safe and precise stacking ensuring lesses accidents caused by stack collapses.For example, instructing the robot precisely to place a sack in the 5th row, 2nd column, on the 4th layer.

- **Stock Monitoring System:** As part of the project, we implemented a comprehensive stock monitoring system. This system allowed real-time tracking of the status and stock levels in the warehouse, ensuring efficient management of rice sacks.

- **Canny Edge Detection:** To count the number of rice sacks accurately, we integrated Canny edge detection technology. This advanced image processing technique helped us precisely determine the quantity of sacks in a stack.

- **AWS Rekognition Integration:** We also leveraged AWS Rekognition for machine learning capabilities. By training the model in AWS Rekognition, we improved our system's ability to recognize and handle rice sacks with higher accuracy.
