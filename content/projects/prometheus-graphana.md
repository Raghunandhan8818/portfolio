## Description

**Prometheus:**
Prometheus, a robust monitoring system, was configured to collect metrics, offering deep insights into the Minikube cluster.

**Grafana:**
Grafana, a powerful visualization tool, was used to create dynamic dashboards for clear and informative metric presentation.

**Key Achievements:**
- Configured Prometheus for metric collection using a Kubernetes ConfigMap.
- Deployed Prometheus as a Kubernetes pod for cluster-wide monitoring.
- Created Grafana dashboards for insightful metric visualization.
- Managed resource cleanup for efficient maintenance.

**Technologies and Tools Used:**
- Minikube, Kubernetes (kubectl), Prometheus, Grafana.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
Highlighted expertise in Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana for monitoring and visualization in a Kubernetes environment.

By showcasing this project, I aim to underline my proficiency in DevOps practices and my ability to leverage monitoring and visualization tools effectively.
