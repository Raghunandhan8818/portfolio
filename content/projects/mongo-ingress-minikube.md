## Description

In this project, I embarked on a journey to develop a robust and scalable system for serving API services using Flask and Sinatra, demonstrating my prowess in both Python and Ruby web development. Here's a breakdown of the key achievements:

- **Database Mastery:** I harnessed the power of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to manage data efficiently, showcasing my adeptness in database technology.

- **Configuring for Deployment:** To ensure seamless deployment, I meticulously crafted configuration files for all the services. This highlights my skills in system configuration and orchestration.

- **Persistent Volumes:** In the pursuit of data integrity, I implemented and configured persistent volumes within a Minikube cluster. This showcases my expertise in managing data storage within containerized environments.

- **Ingress Routing:** I explored the intricacies of Ingress with Nginx, underscoring my proficiency in routing and load balancing, vital for deploying services at scale.

- **Deployment in Minikube:** The culmination of this project was the successful deployment of the entire system in a Minikube cluster, demonstrating my prowess in containerization and Kubernetes orchestration.

This project not only highlights my technical proficiency but also my ability to design and deploy containerized applications efficiently. It stands as a testament to my skills in DevOps, development, and system administration, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
