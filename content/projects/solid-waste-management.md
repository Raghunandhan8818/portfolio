**Project Description:**

Developed the comprehensive Solid Waste Management System designed to enhance waste collection and recycling processes within the campus. This innovative system incorporated various elements to streamline waste management, promote sustainability, and ensure efficient operations. 


**Key Features and Achievements:**

- **Waste Monitoring System:** Developed and implemented a sophisticated waste monitoring system that tracks waste generation, collection, and disposal within my college campus.

- **Mobile Integration with Geofencing:** Integrated the system with a dedicated mobile application used by garbage collectors. Leveraged geofencing technology to precisely locate dustbins, monitor waste collection, and verify completion through photographs.

- **Billing System for Recycling:** Introduced a billing system to incentivize recycling by tracking and rewarding individuals or groups for their active participation in recycling efforts.

**Technology Stack:**

- Utilized a technology stack that included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, and RestFramework.
- Incorporated geofencing APIs to enable location-based monitoring of dustbins and garbage collection.
