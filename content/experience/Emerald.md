### Research Internship

During my tenure as a Research Intern at Emerald Jewel Industry India Limited, I delved into the fascinating world of jewelry design, which presented a unique challenge in the context of machine learning.

**Industry Challenge:**

The jewelry giant faced a monumental challenge. With a catalog comprising over 600,000 design images, the absence of a user-friendly Content Retrieval Management (CRM) system made it cumbersome to search for specific designs. This resulted in significant manual effort, sometimes taking over a week to locate similar designs, or necessitating the creation of entirely new molds, incurring unnecessary expenses.

**Experience Highlights:**

- Addressed the challenge of improving design retrieval in the world's largest jewelry manufacturing industry.
- Developed a **machine learning model** to find similar design images for customer queries.
- Overcame difficulties presented by shared design features, such as round shapes and gold coloring.
- Employed diverse methodologies, including data augmentations, **Pytorch CycleGan**, Gaussian Thresholding, **Local Feature Detection**, **SIFT Keypoint Detection**, **Canny Edge Detection**, **Dense Representations**, Feature and Metric-Based Search, Template Matching, and **Triplet Loss functions**.
- Combined the results of these methodologies to create a **Content Retrieval Management (CRM)** system.
- Achieved rapid design retrieval, providing resultant and similar images in under 3 seconds.
- **Reduced manual design search times from over 7 days to mere seconds.**
- Slashed costs by eliminating the need to recreate molds for designs, resulting in **notable expense reduction.**
- Improved industry productivity by streamlining design retrieval and reducing manual labor.
- Brought about a transformative change in the industry, resulting in substantial time saving, cost reduction, and enhanced manufacturing efficiency.
