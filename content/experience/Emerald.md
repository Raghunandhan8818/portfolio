### Research Internship

During my tenure as a Research Intern at Emerald Jewel Industry India Limited, I delved into the fascinating world of jewelry design, which presented a unique challenge in the context of machine learning.

**Industry Challenge:**

The jewelry giant faced a monumental challenge. With a catalog comprising over 600,000 design images, the absence of a user-friendly Content Retrieval Management (CRM) system made it cumbersome to search for specific designs. This resulted in significant manual effort, sometimes taking over a week to locate similar designs, or necessitating the creation of entirely new molds, incurring unnecessary expenses.

**Experience Highlights:**

- Addressed the challenge of improving design retrieval in the world's largest jewelry manufacturing industry, enhancing the customer experience.

- Developed an **innovative machine learning model** to swiftly locate similar design images based on customer queries.

- Successfully overcame issues related to shared design features like round shapes and gold coloring, ensuring precise image retrieval.

- Employed a wide range of techniques, including data augmentations, **Pytorch CycleGan**, **Gaussian Thresholding**, and more, to create a robust Content Retrieval Management (CRM) system.

- Achieved rapid design retrieval, providing customers with relevant images in under 3 seconds, a significant improvement from the previous manual search process that took over 7 days.

- Revolutionized the industry by significantly reducing costs, eliminating the need to recreate molds for designs, and boosting manufacturing efficiency, resulting in substantial time and expense savings.
